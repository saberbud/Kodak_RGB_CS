This is a self-contained package of applying our CS method to Kodak RGB examples.
The CS is applied to Kodak RGB images in a channel-by-channel manner.

1. The example data is stored in ./Kodak_examples_uncompressed
2. Sub-packages of using CS with kernel of dimension [k,k,1,4] is named Kodak_RGB_kk4.

More detailed illustration: Kodak_RGB_884 for example.
K.1 Predict_884_fix_codes_RGBKD.ipynb tests the full flow of compression and decompression, as well as presenting the comparisons of original and reconstructed RGB images and the metrics.
K.2 Trained models are stored in model_...
K.3 JP2k_glymur_test.ipynb is used to compress original RGB images with JP2K, for comparisons with CS with and without entropy coding (arcode).
K.4 JPEG_PIL_test.ipynb is used to compress original RGB images with JPEG, for comparisons with CS with and without entropy coding (arcode).
