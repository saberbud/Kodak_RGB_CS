The entropy-coding tests can be found in each sub-folder for the COMPINTs of specific type.

The arcode tests test_CI_arcode_KD.ipynb includes the decoding tests this time: function ar_decode. This is used to make sure the reconstruction from arcode reproduces the input integer array, as can be seen in the code.

The Kodak examples in the paper are the 3, 22, and 23 of the full Kodak dataset.
